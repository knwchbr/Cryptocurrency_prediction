How to run this demo

The demo requires Python 3.6 or 3.7 (The version of TensorFlow we specify in requirements.txt is not supported in Python 3.8+). We suggest creating a new virtual environment, then running:

git clone https://github.com/knwchbr/Cryptocurrency_prediction.git

cd Project_Bitcoin_Prediction

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run main.py
